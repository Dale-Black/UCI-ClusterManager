# GitHub Actions Build Fix

## Problem
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing because it tried to use conda, which isn't available on GitHub's runners:

```
conda: command not found
/etc/profile.d/conda.sh: No such file or directory
```

## Solution
Updated the workflow to build directly with PyInstaller instead of using the `direct_build.sh` script (which requires conda).

## What Changed

### Local Development (unchanged)
- You can still use `./build_app.sh` locally, which uses conda environment `hpc_env`
- The `scripts/direct_build.sh` script still works for local builds

### GitHub Actions CI/CD (fixed)
- Now builds directly with PyInstaller using the system Python
- Uses `pip` to install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- No conda dependency required

## File Modified
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - Line 26-47

## Next Steps

Commit and push this fix:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/build.yml
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Actions: Remove conda dependency, build directly with PyInstaller"
git push origin main
```

Then create your release tag:

```bash
git tag v0.0.2
git push origin v0.0.2
```

The build should now succeed! ✅

## Why This Works

GitHub Actions runners come with:
- ✅ Python pre-installed
- ✅ pip pre-installed
- ✅ All the dependencies we need via `requirements.txt`
- ❌ NO conda (and we don't need it for CI builds)

The conda environment is useful for local development to keep dependencies isolated, but on GitHub Actions each job runs in a clean environment anyway, so we can use pip directly.
