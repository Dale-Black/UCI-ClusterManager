## Backup

A backup of the original workflow file was created at:
```
.github/workflows/build.yml.backup
```

To restore if needed:
```bash
cp .github/workflows/build.yml.backup .github/workflows/build.yml
```

## Testing

The updated workflow will be tested when you push your next tag. The changes are backwards compatible and should work without any modifications to your build process.

## Next Steps

1. Commit the updated workflow file:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/build.yml
   git commit -m "Update GitHub Actions to v4 (fix deprecation warnings)"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Create your release tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v0.0.2
   git push origin v0.0.2
   ```

The build should now complete successfully without deprecation warnings!
